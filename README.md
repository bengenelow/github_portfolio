# PORTFOLIO

# LIMO Autonomous Navigation Project

> 🚀 A real-world robotics trainee project using the AgileX LIMO robot and ROS, with a focus on systems engineering, team collaboration, and technical implementation.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a **company-style robotics development cycle**, where we were tasked with designing and building a physical arena and programming the **LIMO robot** to navigate autonomously within it. The goal was to mirror how robotics engineers work in industry—with stakeholder constraints, technical design trade-offs, and collaborative implementation.

## 🎯 Objective

- Design and construct a shared **physical arena** reflecting real-world constraints  
- Program the **AgileX LIMO** robot for autonomous navigation  
- Work as a trainee **Robotics Systems Engineer** on both technical and project coordination aspects  
- Deliver a functional **robotic system** that meets predefined stakeholder needs

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role

- Led arena design coordination and physical layout planning  
- Developed and tested LIMO robot navigation logic using **ROS**  
- Ensured robot-path compatibility with environment constraints  
- Facilitated team progress, meeting deadlines and project deliverables
